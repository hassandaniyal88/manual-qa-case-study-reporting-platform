<h1>Building a Scalable Multi-Agency Reporting System: A QA-Led Case Study</h1>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>
In 2025–2026, I was responsible for QA on one of the most complex modules of a national-scale public safety platform.
The platform enables civilians to submit incident reports that must be routed to the correct public safety agency anywhere in the United States.
To achieve this, the system uses a multi-workspace architecture, where each agency operates in its own isolated workspace with custom rules, users, and activation states.
</p>

<p>
My role as QA was not only to test functionality, but also to analyze requirements, identify logic gaps, validate user flows,
write clarification questions, and ensure that all roles, workspaces, and workflows behaved consistently across the entire system.
</p>

<p>
This case study documents how I, as a QA Engineer, helped build and validate a scalable multi-agency system that supports nationwide onboarding.
</p>

<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
<p>The system supports four primary user roles, each with different permissions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Civilian Users</li>
    <li>Agency Staff</li>
    <li>Supervisory Users</li>
    <li>System Admins</li>
</ul>

<p>Each agency has its own workspace containing:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Its own users</li>
    <li>Its own reports</li>
    <li>Its own public content</li>
    <li>Its own activation status (Draft → Pending → Live)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The challenge was to implement an engine that allows a civilian anywhere in the country to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Search and join their local agency</li>
    <li>Switch agencies if traveling</li>
    <li>Submit reports with correct routing</li>
    <li>See public information in a statewide, role-filtered format</li>
    <li>Follow strict logic rules that vary by user type</li>
</ul>

<p>This required deep testing, requirement discovery, and logic refinement.</p>

<h2>THE CHALLENGE</h2>

<p>The initial documentation for this module had several issues:</p>

<h3>1. Requirements were incomplete or contradictory</h3>
<p>Multiple documents had different expectations for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Agency activation states</li>
    <li>Cross-agency visibility</li>
    <li>Report routing</li>
    <li>Public post visibility</li>
    <li>Subscription/contract workflows</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Many real-world scenarios were not defined</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Civilian lives in one city but reports an incident in another</li>
    <li>An agency is visible but not accepting reports</li>
    <li>Public content overlaps between agencies</li>
    <li>Multi-step subscription logic with many states</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Complex multi-role behavior</h3>
<p>Rules applied differently depending on role, workspace state, or report type.</p>

<h3>4. No single source of truth</h3>
<p>Implementation spanned multiple documents, emails, UI files, and refinement notes.</p>

<h2>MY ROLE AS QA ENGINEER</h2>

<p>I took a leadership role in defining clarity, structure, and consistency. My responsibilities included:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Requirements Analysis</strong> — cross-checking all major documents and identifying missing logic.</li>
    <li><strong>Logic Gap Detection</strong> — discovering undefined or conflicting behaviors.</li>
    <li><strong>Clarification Questions</strong> — validating assumptions with the client early.</li>
    <li><strong>Full QA Planning</strong> — designing detailed scenarios across roles, states, and workflows.</li>
    <li><strong>Defect Identification</strong> — testing and finding system-level issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Ticket Creation</strong> — converting vague requirements into dev-ready acceptance criteria.</li>
    <li><strong>Maintaining Feedback Tracking</strong> — ensuring alignment between QA, dev, and product.</li>
</ul>

<h2>KEY LOGIC GAPS I DISCOVERED</h2>

<h3>Gap 1 — Cross-agency visibility rules were inconsistent</h3>
<p>Should civilians see:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Only their agency’s content?</li>
    <li>Nearby agencies?</li>
    <li>Full statewide feed?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>After QA-led clarification:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>User’s Primary Agency</li>
    <li>Nearby Agencies (based on configuration)</li>
    <li>Statewide Content</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gap 2 — Undefined agency compatibility for report submissions</h3>
<p>
Civilians could enter an incident address that didn’t match the selected agency.
</p>

<p><strong>After my QA inquiry:</strong> A compatibility fail-safe modal was introduced.</p>

<h3>Gap 3 — Activation state behavior was unclear</h3>
<p>Rules for Draft, Pending, and Live states were not defined.</p>

<p><strong>Final clarification:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Draft → not public</li>
    <li>Pending → selectable but cannot receive reports</li>
    <li>Live → fully active</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gap 4 — Civilian data persistence not defined</h3>
<p>Clarified: Civilian data belongs to the user, not the agency.</p>

<h3>Gap 5 — Subscription lifecycle missing contract instance rules</h3>
<p>
Defined the rule: each agency must have one active contract instance.
</p>

<h2>QA SOLUTIONS & CONTRIBUTIONS</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Created a unified logic model</li>
    <li>Developed 60+ structured test cases</li>
    <li>Merged conflicting requirements into one truth source</li>
    <li>Improved developer clarity with actionable tickets</li>
    <li>Strengthened client communication</li>
    <li>Validated scalability for nationwide onboarding</li>
</ul>

<h2>OUTCOME & IMPACT</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Zero misrouted reports</strong> after compatibility fail-safe</li>
    <li><strong>Faster agency onboarding</strong> due to clear activation logic</li>
    <li><strong>Architecture stability</strong> through clarified requirements</li>
    <li><strong>Reduced rework</strong> via precise QA-driven logic</li>
    <li><strong>Consistent UX</strong> across all user roles</li>
</ul>

<h2>WHAT I LEARNED</h2>

<ul>
    <li>QA is not just testing — it’s product thinking</li>
    <li>Clarification early prevents weeks of rework</li>
    <li>Complex systems require structured decision trees</li>
    <li>Documentation must match real behavior</li>
    <li>QA protects users, developers, and the business</li>
</ul>

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>
Building a scalable multi-agency reporting engine requires more than code — it requires clear logic, deep testing, and proactive QA leadership.
Through systematic analysis, continuous clarification, and structured testing, I ensured the system could scale nationwide while maintaining accuracy, reliability, and usability.
